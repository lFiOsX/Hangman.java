Hi!

This is my first big (for me) project. I have been studying JAVA for 2 months.

My assumptions:

1.Possibility to enter a password.

2.Show user, how much is a letter in password.

3.Save missed letters and show it.

4.Graphic Hangman.


Before you start playing, adjust the console for better effect!
